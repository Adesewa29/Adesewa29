### Projects & Case Studies

#### Equifax Data Breach â€“ Case Study (Incident Response)
Analyzed one of the largest data breaches in U.S. history, focusing on how poor patch management led to massive data exposure affecting 147 million consumers.

*Tools Used:* Open-source intelligence, CVE databases, and report writing  
*Key Takeaway:* Emphasized the critical importance of timely patching and robust access control mechanisms in enterprise security.

#### Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark
Performed packet inspection and analyzed captured traffic to detect suspicious activity and potential security threats in enterprise environments.

*Tools Used:* Wireshark, Kali Linux, Network protocol analyzers  
*Key Takeaway:* Learned how to identify abnormal traffic patterns and detect network intrusions through deep packet analysis.

#### Penetration Testing on Simulated Servers
Executed ethical hacking labs on TryHackMe and HackTheBox platforms to test vulnerabilities in web applications and systems.

*Tools Used:* Nmap, Burp Suite, Kali Linux toolkit  
*Key Takeaway:* Enhanced practical skills in reconnaissance, vulnerability exploitation, and privilege escalation techniques.

#### Enterprise Network Segmentation with Cisco Packet Tracer
Designed and implemented secure network architecture using VLAN segmentation and access control lists to prevent lateral movement.

*Tools Used:* Cisco Packet Tracer, VLAN configuration, Access Control Lists  
*Key Takeaway:* Demonstrated how proper network segmentation can contain security breaches and limit attacker movement.

#### SQL Injection Testing with PortSwigger Academy
Identified and exploited SQL injection vulnerabilities including UNION-based attacks and blind SQLi to extract sensitive database information.

*Tools Used:* PortSwigger Burp Suite,Manual injection techniques  
*Key Takeaway:* Mastered SQL injection detection and exploitation, understanding parameterized queries as primary defense.

#### Cryptographic Operations with OpenSSL
Performed cryptographic operations including encryption/decryption, digital certificates, and hash functions using OpenSSL.

*Tools Used:* OpenSSL, RSA/AES encryption, SHA hashing, Digital certificates  
*Key Takeaway:* Gained practical understanding of cryptographic fundamentals for securing data transmission.

#### Encoding & Cipher Analysis with CyberChef
Implemented encoding schemes and classical ciphers including Base64 encoding and Caesar cipher cryptanalysis.

*Tools Used:* CyberChef, Base64 encoding, Caesar cipher techniques  
*Key Takeaway:* Developed skills in recognizing encoding patterns and breaking simple ciphers.

#### Phishing Campaign Analysis
Studied phishing techniques by analyzing phishing links and emails to understand attacker methodologies and develop detection strategies.

*Tools Used:* URL obfuscation analysis,Social engineering frameworks  
*Key Takeaway:* Understanding phishing mechanics from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
